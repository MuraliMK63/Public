# Get File content using Url program


# Here I imported requests library in order to make HTTP request
import requests
import html2text
link = input("Enter Your URL:")
# GET method is used to request data from the server
content = requests.get(link)
# And text is basically used to get text from the server 
print(content.text)
# For Normal text content of the server, you can use "html2text" package
# I also provided the code snippet below so that you can check it
print(html2text.html2text(content.text))
